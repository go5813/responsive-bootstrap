	<h2>The Saga</h2>

 <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="portrait">

<p>
	<b>George</b> was born and raised in Kenya where he became an expert at picking his own switch from the bush, soap bar sculpting, and a brilliant bass singer in a boys choir. He also swam in one of Africa's great lakes as he bathed <i>'just because he could!'</i>.
</p>
<p>
	Being the youngest of 15, this tall stick figured man, never cracked a smile despite his warm enterpreneurial spirit. At the age of 20, George put his Kenyan running roots to full throttle and booked a flight to Atlanta GA USA. Now this dandy enjoys testing his flat footed chicken legs along the Atlanta belt line.
</p>
<p>
	In 2013 he married his green eyed, red haired, fair skinned chai latte. George is living his <strong><i>happy ever after</i></strong> somewhere in the burrows of Atlanta with their 4 kids "3 poodles and a kerry blue terrier".
